## Bug reports

When reporting a bug please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Documentation improvements

locked_dict could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official locked_dict docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

## Feature requests and feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that code contributions are welcome :)
